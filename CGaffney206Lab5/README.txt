This is used to type in examples in the url in case Swagger takes forever loading anything.

Example URLs to type in:

https://localhost:5001/api/soccerplayers for the entire list of soccer players

api/soccerplayers/10 will give a certain player's info.  10, 26, 218118, 109060 are some to try, just not any number works

api/soccerplayers/?position=Midfield			Midfield, Defender, Goalkeeper, Attack are some examples

This stuff worked on my computer. I'm hoping you'll be able to see the data on yours.
If you need the databases, there in our group project: group-project-i-brownie-bandits under  SportsLeagues.
